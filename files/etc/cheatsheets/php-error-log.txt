---- Details ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- error_log (string) --

Name of the file where script errors should be logged. The file should be writable by the web server's user.
If the special value syslog is used, the errors are sent to the system logger instead.
On Unix, this means syslog(3) and on Windows NT it means the event log. See also: syslog().

If this directive is not set, errors are sent to the SAPI error logger.
For example, it is an error log in Apache or stderr in CLI. See also error_log().

-- error_reporting (integer) --

Set the error reporting level. The parameter is either an integer representing a bit field, or named constants.
The error_reporting levels and constants are described in Predefined Constants, and in php.ini. To set at runtime,
use the error_reporting() function. See also the display_errors directive.

>= PHP 5.3 - the default value is E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED.
<  PHP 5.3 - the default value is E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT.

E_ALL (integer)	 All errors and warnings, as supported, except of level E_STRICT prior to PHP 5.4.0.
>= PHP 5.4 - 32767
>= PHP 5.3 - 30719
>= PHP 5.2 - 6143

-- display_errors (string) --

This determines whether errors should be printed to the screen as part of the output or if they should be hidden
from the user. Value "stderr" sends the errors to stderr instead of stdout.

Note:
Although display_errors may be set at runtime (with ini_set()), it won't have any effect if the script has fatal
errors. This is because the desired runtime action does not get executed.

-- display_startup_errors (boolean) --

Even when display_errors is on, errors that occur during PHP's startup sequence are not displayed.
It's strongly recommended to keep display_startup_errors off, except for debugging.

-- html_errors (boolean) --

Turn off HTML tags in error messages. The new format for HTML errors produces clickable messages that direct
the user to a page describing the error or function in causing the error. These references are affected by
docref_root and docref_ext.

-- log_errors (boolean) --

Tells whether script error messages should be logged to the server's error log or error_log.
This option is server-specific.

-- log_errors_max_len (integer) --

Set the maximum length of log_errors in bytes. In error_log information about the source is added. The default is 1024
and 0 allows to not apply any maximum length at all. This length is applied to logged errors, displayed errors and
also to $php_errormsg.

When an integer is used, the value is measured in bytes. Shorthand notation, as described in this FAQ, may also be used.
